Only 1 week after releasing Typo 5.4, we're back with another cool Typo release. Since it was fixing a major security breach, Typo 5.4 was released a bit too quickly, and we left some bugs here and there we promptly fixed. So don't expect any new feature here, it's only about bug fixing and refactoring. Apparently, Matijs and Cyril had great fun doing this. I started to work on the first Typo user's guide as in our documentation effort. The 0.1 version is provided in Typo 5.4.1. We've also upgraded every theme at Typogarden to make them 5.4.1 compliant.

Since we're still working on what we want to see in the next Typo, don't mind opening a ticket to ask for something you want.

[#68] Atom feed has duplicated content
There was a duplicate content in atom feed because of the use of atom:summary with extended content. Since summary is not mandatory, and it should not duplicate content, we've decided to remove it one from the feed. 

[#75] <typo:code> textfilter need change all < by &lt; in atom feed

[#86] Migrations out of necessary sequence

[#124] &gt; and &lt; entities are decoded in the atom feed

[#126] Previews give an application error 

[#127] Changing post's title changes the permalink slug

[#128] Fix typogarden themes
Seems obvious isn't it?

[#130] Theme editor textbox is too small
There was actually wet paint in our new admin. We fixed that quickly.

[#131] New Tags are created two times
The way autosave on new / saved articles worked was quite complicated and ended with strange behavior.

[#132] Categories are brocken
A typo in the category views.

[#133] Installer parameter database=sqlite3 doesn't work
Awated parameter was database=sqlite, but since this could be confusing, we've made sqlite3 avaliable as well.

[#134] "Continue reading ..." link appears for posts that do not have additional content. 
This one was actually the tree hiding the forest of all our themes being brocken because it constant renaming of the read controller and action name.
